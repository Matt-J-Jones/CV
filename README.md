## Matt Jones                               
    
I am a career changer with 7 years of experience in project management, now transitioning to a software development career. 

My main achievement is teaching myself enough programming to qualify for a Master's level program in Game Design, which has given me a solid foundation in coding and development principles. What i find exciting about tech is the limitless potential for innovation, particularly in game development and AI, and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on people's lives through technology.
