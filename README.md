I am a career changer with seven years of experience in project management, currently transitioning to a software development career.

What excites me most about technology is its limitless potential for innovation, especially in game development and AI. I am thrilled about the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience to create meaningful technology that positively impacts people's lives.
